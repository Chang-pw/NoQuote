# What Makes an Ideal Quote? Recommending "Unexpected yet Rational" Quotations via Novelty

English | [中文](README_zh.md)

Our work is accepted at **ACL 2026 Main Conference Oral Presentation**.

> **TL;DR:** We propose NovelQR for quotation recommendation to find quotes that are unexpected yet rational, combining deep-meaning retrieval with token-level novelty reranking to enhance aesthetic value in writing.

## Overview

Quotation recommendation aims to enrich writing by suggesting quotes that complement a given context, yet existing systems mostly optimize surface-level topical relevance and ignore the deeper semantic and aesthetic properties that make quotations memorable. We start from two empirical observations: (1) people consistently prefer quotations that are "unexpected yet rational" in context, and (2) strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations.

We operationalize this objective with **NovelQR**, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework:

- **Label Enhancement**: A generative label agent interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval.
- **Rationality Retrieval**: Retrieves candidate quotations that are semantically relevant and filters them by deep meaning and labels.
- **Novelty Reranking**: A token-level novelty estimator reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
conda create -n NovelQuote python=3.10
conda activate NovelQuote
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the Quote Data

The original quotation data comes from [QUILL](https://github.com/GraceXiaoo/QUILL). The label-enhanced data processed by our Label Agent is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Changpw/Noquote). Put the data in the `data/quote/` folder.

### Configuration

Set the config in `config.json`:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `API_KEY` | API key for GPT-4o (used as Label Agent) |
| `BASE_MODEL` | Path to local backbone model (recommend Qwen3-8B) |
| `EMD_MODEL` | Path to embedding model |

### Run the Retrieval Pipeline

8 GPUs Batch Inference + KVCache for deployment:

```bash
bash run_GPUS.sh
```
